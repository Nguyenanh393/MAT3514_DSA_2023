You are a seagull. The chimpanzee is right about that, but only about that. We all love you, Lucky. And we love you because you are a seagull. A beautiful seagull. I haven't contradicted you when I've heard you squawk that you're a cat, because it flatters us that you want to be like us, but you're different and we're happy that you're different. We weren't able to help your mother, but we can help you. We've protected you from the moment you pecked your way out of your shell. We've given you all our affection without ever thinking of making a cat out of you. We love you as a gull. We feel that you love us too, that we're your friends, your family, and we want you to know that with you we've learned something that makes us very proud: We've learned to appreciate and respect and love someone who's different from us. It's very easy to accept and love those who are like us, but to love someone different is very hard, and you have helped us do that. You are a seagull, and you must follow your destiny as a seagull. You must fly. When you do learn, Lucky, I prom- ise you that you'll be happy, and then your feelings toward us and ours for you will be even deeper and more beautiful because it will be affection between totally different creatures.
